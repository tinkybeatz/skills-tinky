# STANDARD: AGILE BACKLOG MANAGEMENT (embedded for apply skill)

- Status: Active
- Version: 1.4.0
- Owner: Product Management
- Approvers: Engineering Manager, Tech Lead, QA Lead
- Effective date: 2026-03-05
- Last review date: 2026-03-05

## 1) Purpose

Define a single, evidence-based standard for creating, structuring, prioritizing, and maintaining a product backlog in an Agile software project.

Primary outcomes:

- maximize delivered value
- keep backlog transparent and actionable
- reduce planning noise and delivery churn
- increase implementation readiness for technical delivery at runtime/system boundaries

This standard aligns with Agile values and Scrum guidance on value, empiricism, and Product Backlog management. [SRC-001] [SRC-002]

## 2) Scope

Applies to:

- all product and engineering teams maintaining a shared backlog
- all backlog item types: epics, features, user stories, bugs, enablers, spikes
- all planning horizons: now, next, later

Does not replace:

- team-level engineering implementation conventions
- security or compliance standards

## 3) Normative Language

- `MUST`: mandatory requirement
- `MUST NOT`: forbidden practice
- `SHOULD`: recommended unless justified exception
- `MAY`: optional practice

## 4) Agile Backlog Principles

1. The backlog MUST remain an ordered, evolving list of work needed to improve the product. [SRC-002]
2. Backlog decisions MUST prioritize value and outcomes over output volume. [SRC-001] [SRC-007]
3. Refinement MUST be continuous and collaborative, not a one-time phase. [SRC-002] [SRC-003]
4. Backlog items SHOULD meet quality heuristics (INVEST for stories, DEEP for backlog health). [SRC-004] [SRC-005]
5. For architecture/runtime-heavy scopes, backlog artifacts MUST include technical execution details beyond generic product framing.

## 5) Roles and Accountability

### Product Owner

- MUST be accountable for maximizing product value.
- MUST own Product Backlog ordering.
- MUST ensure backlog is transparent and understood.

These accountabilities are non-delegable in ownership, even when execution support exists. [SRC-002]

### Developers / Engineering Team

- MUST contribute to refinement, sizing, and feasibility assessment.
- MUST flag dependency, risk, and technical ambiguity before sprint commitment.

### Stakeholders

- SHOULD provide evidence and context for requests.
- MUST NOT bypass backlog governance with direct untracked commitments.

## 6) Backlog Structure Standard

The backlog MUST be organized across three horizons:

1. `Now` (ready for next 1-2 sprints)
2. `Next` (candidate work, partially refined)
3. `Later` (opportunities requiring discovery)

The backlog MUST keep one explicit `Product Goal` reference to guide ordering decisions. [SRC-002]

Each item MUST belong to one of these types:

- `Feature`
- `User Story`
- `Bug`
- `Enabler`
- `Spike`

`Epic` MAY be used as a grouping container, but MUST NOT be committed directly to a sprint.

Backlog artifact traceability requirement:

- Every backlog document MUST include a dedicated section named `Standards Traceability Matrix`.
- The matrix MUST map each cited standard to:
  - covered backlog scope/items
  - verification or release gate references
  - expected evidence artifacts.

### 6.1 Technical Backlog Profile (mandatory for engineering-intensive scopes)

A backlog MUST adopt the `Technical Backlog Profile` when at least one condition is true:

1. impacts runtime orchestration, module boundaries, protocols, or execution routing
2. introduces or modifies security-sensitive decision flows
3. includes fallback/retry/state-machine behavior
4. depends on AI model decisions affecting runtime behavior

When this profile is active, backlog artifacts MUST include:

- `Target Architecture` section
- `Execution Paths` section (primary path + fallback path)
- `Service Contract Inventory` section (input/output contracts and owners)
- `State Machine` section with state transitions and terminal outcomes
- `Failure Taxonomy` section with mapped remediation behavior
- `Security Invariants` section (non-bypass guarantees)
- `Observability Contract` section with required correlation IDs and SLO metrics
- `ADR Decisions to Lock` section
- `Delivery Sequencing` section with explicit rollout phases

## 7) Mandatory Item Template

Every sprint-candidate item MUST include:

- unique ID
- concise title
- problem statement / user value
- `Evidence links` field using evidence IDs from the backlog Evidence Register (example: `Evidence links: E-ARCH-005, E-CICD-001, E-RUN-LIVE`)
- acceptance criteria
- links to evidence (qualitative/quantitative)
- estimate (relative size or effort band)
- dependencies / constraints
- risk notes
- owner
- target horizon (`Now`/`Next`/`Later`)
- release-readiness gate definition (required checks/commands)
- release evidence expectations and go/no-go decision owner [SRC-008]

For user stories, teams SHOULD use INVEST as a quality check before commitment. [SRC-004]

Evidence-link formatting rule:

- Every `Now` item MUST include at least:
  - one evidence link to an applicable standard
  - one evidence link to runtime/test/operational validation source.

### 7.1 Mandatory technical fields for `Now` items in Technical Backlog Profile

In addition to section 7, each `Now` item MUST include:

- affected components/modules
- contract impact (`new`/`changed`/`none`) and contract IDs
- data/security impact classification
- failure handling strategy (`retry`, `fallback`, `fail-fast`, `manual`)
- test scope declaration (unit/integration/e2e/security/performance)
- telemetry expectations (metrics/logs/traces)

## 8) Definition of Ready for Sprint Candidates

An item is `Ready` only if all conditions are met:

1. value and objective are explicit
2. acceptance criteria are testable
3. dependencies are identified
4. scope is small enough for one sprint
5. estimate is agreed by the team
6. no critical ambiguity remains
7. release-readiness gates and expected evidence are explicitly defined [SRC-008]

Additional `Ready` checks for Technical Backlog Profile:

8. contract impacts are identified and owned
9. failure behavior is defined
10. security implications are explicit
11. observability fields are defined

Rule:

- items failing any `Ready` criterion MUST stay out of sprint commitment.

## 9) Prioritization Standard

### 9.1 Ordering policy

Backlog ordering MUST be explicit and explainable.

Minimum factors:

- business/user value
- time criticality
- risk reduction or opportunity enablement
- implementation effort

### 9.2 Recommended method

Teams SHOULD use a WSJF-like decision model for larger backlogs:

`Priority Score = (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement) / Effort` [SRC-006]

If another method is used, teams MUST document:

- formula or decision criteria
- tie-breaker rule
- review cadence

### 9.3 Reprioritization triggers

Backlog order MUST be reviewed when at least one occurs:

- new high-impact customer evidence
- production incident with product impact
- major dependency or capacity change
- strategic objective change

## 10) Refinement Cadence and WIP Controls

1. Refinement MUST happen continuously during each sprint. [SRC-002] [SRC-003]
2. Teams MUST maintain at least one sprint of `Ready` work.
3. Teams SHOULD cap `In Refinement` WIP to avoid analysis queue overload.

Recommended baseline:

- weekly refinement session (60-90 min)
- max 10 items actively refined per team at once

## 11) Sprint Planning Integration

1. Sprint Planning MUST start from ordered and sufficiently ready backlog items. [SRC-002]
2. Sprint Goal MUST drive final item selection. [SRC-002]
3. Teams MUST NOT pull large ambiguous items into a sprint.
4. Mid-sprint scope change SHOULD be exceptional and explicitly logged.
5. Release-candidate items MUST maintain traceability to the release-readiness standard and required go/no-go evidence. [SRC-008]

## 12) Backlog Quality and Health Metrics

Teams MUST track backlog health monthly.

Minimum metrics:

- `Readiness Ratio`: ready items / top 20 items
- `Backlog Churn`: % priority changes in top 10 per sprint
- `Aging`: average days items remain in `Now`
- `Completion Predictability`: planned vs completed items per sprint
- `Outcome Linkage`: % completed items linked to measurable outcome hypothesis
- `Release Gate Coverage`: % `Now` items with explicit release-readiness gates and evidence plan [SRC-008]

Additional metrics required for Technical Backlog Profile:

- `Contract Completeness`: % `Now` items with explicit contract impact field
- `Failure Policy Coverage`: % `Now` items with explicit fallback/failure strategy
- `Observability Coverage`: % `Now` items with telemetry expectations

Outcome metrics SHOULD map to Evidence-Based Management value areas (Current Value, Unrealized Value, Time-to-Market, Ability to Innovate). [SRC-007]

Default thresholds:

- Readiness Ratio >= 70%
- Backlog Churn (top 10) <= 30% per sprint
- 100% of sprint items linked to acceptance criteria
- Release Gate Coverage = 100% for `Now` items
- Contract Completeness = 100% for Technical Backlog Profile `Now` items
- Failure Policy Coverage = 100% for Technical Backlog Profile `Now` items
- Observability Coverage = 100% for Technical Backlog Profile `Now` items

## 13) Governance and Decision Traceability

1. Major backlog decisions MUST be recorded (what changed, why, expected impact).
2. High-impact prioritization changes MUST include at least 2 evidence references.
3. Conflicting stakeholder requests MUST be resolved through documented tradeoff decisions.
4. Exception decisions MUST include owner and expiry date.

## 14) Anti-Patterns (Prohibited or Discouraged)

Teams MUST NOT:

- treat backlog as a static requirement document
- commit unrefined work based only on urgency pressure
- optimize for story count instead of outcomes
- keep zombie items with no owner, no evidence, and no decision
- publish architecture/runtime backlogs without explicit execution-path and failure behavior sections

Teams SHOULD NOT:

- rewrite priority every day without new evidence
- overload top backlog with loosely scoped initiatives

## 15) Source Citation Rules for Backlog Decisions

For high-impact backlog decisions, evidence entries MUST include:

- source title
- path/URL
- publication/update date when available
- one-line relevance rationale

Critical claims without citations are non-compliant.

## 16) Review and Change Management

- this standard MUST be reviewed every 6 months
- version increments:
  - `MAJOR`: structural method change
  - `MINOR`: new rules or thresholds
  - `PATCH`: clarifications without policy impact
